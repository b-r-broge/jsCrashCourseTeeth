# jsCrashCourseTeeth
Using some good ol' vanilla JavaScript to change element styles.

The purpose of this is to simply demonstrate one of the ways that JavaScript can interact with HTML and CSS.

### The basic sequence of events for this go as follows:

1) Click button that represents drinking coffee.
  Unfortunately, while delicious, coffee is acidic and can cause discoloration of the tooth over time.
  We're going to use a click event to represent that color change

2) For additional practice with click events, we're going to trigger another color change.
  This one represents the magic of teeth cleaning.

3) We also want to keep track of how much coffee is consumed so that after a certain amount, a cavity appears.
  When this happens, we want to alert the user of their cavity.
